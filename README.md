# Genesis Automatic Term Headline

Automatically adds a headline to the term archive page, the same as the name of taxonomy term, if no explicit value is given.

## Description 

In Genesis, the headline on the term archive page only appears if a value is given. This plugin changes that behaviour so that the default value is the name of the term itself, instead of an empty string.

The field on the Edit Term page will still be empty, so if you enter a custom headline, this value will be used instead.
